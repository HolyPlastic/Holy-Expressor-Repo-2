# AI AGENT MANDATORY PROTOCOL

Before you analyze this repository, write any code, or execute any commands, you MUST read the following file:

`AGENTS/00_START_HERE.md`

  

Read ONLY that file first. Then, evaluate the user's prompt and use the routing instructions inside `00_START_HERE.md` to determine which specific files you need to fetch next. Do not preemptively read all linked documents.
