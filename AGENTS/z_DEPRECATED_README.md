# Holy Expressor — Agent Documentation Entry

This folder is the central developer/agent documentation area.

## Start here (new roadmap)

1. `AGENTS/AGENT_INDEX.md` — compressed global rules + routing index.
2. `AGENTS/ROADMAP_TASK_ROUTER.md` — task → minimum reading path.
3. `AGENTS/ROADMAP_CODE_MAP.md` — verified module/file map.
4. `AGENTS/DOCS_STATUS_MAP.md` — trust model for all docs.

## Historical/context docs

- `AGENTS/DEV ARCHIVE.md` (history; do not rewrite)
- `AGENTS/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` (non-canonical memory)
- `AGENTS/EXAMPLES.md` (style and SVG patterns)
- `AGENTS/ENVIRONMENT.md` (setup)
- `AGENTS/PICK CLICK SPECIFIC/*` (PickClick-only, quarantined for general tasks)

## Rule of use

When docs conflict with implementation, code is source of truth.
